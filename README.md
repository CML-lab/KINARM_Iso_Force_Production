# KINARM_Iso_Force_Production

This is a basic isometric force production task on the Kinarm. This task has two phases: an MVC assessment phase, and a test phase.

In the MVC assessment phase, participants are asked to flex about a single joint as much as possible and maintain that level of force for a brief time; successful holds are those that maintain the force within some range for the trial duration. The MVC force is recorded on each successful trial, and all successful trials are averaged to estimate the MVC.

In the test phase, participants are asked to flex about a single joint to achieve differing percentages of the MVC, and maintain that requested level of force for a brief time. Particpiants may or may not recieve visual feedback about the amount of force they are currently exerting. Trials are successful if the requested force level is achieved and maintained for the required duration.
